# Recursive Functions in C++

This repository contains examples and exercises on recursive functions in C++. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve problems efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

### Examples:
1. **Factorial Calculation** - Computes factorial using recursion.
2. **Reversing a String** - Reverses a string using recursion.
3. **Computing Power** - Calculates X^N recursively.
4. **Ackermann Function** - Demonstrates the Ackermann recursive function.

### Exercises:
1. **Print 2^N (for N = 0 to 20)**
2. **Print numbers from N to 0**
3. **Compute Binomial Coefficients using Recursion**
4. **Check if a number is Prime using Recursion**
