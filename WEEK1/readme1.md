# Week 1 - C++ Review 
This chapter provides a review of fundamental C++ programming concepts, ensuring a solid understanding of key features. The topics covered include:

1. Data Types and Operators: The focus was on understanding the basic as well as complex data types such as (char, float, int, string etc.) and the operations that go along with them.
2. Functions: Revision of concepts of function declaration, definition, and usage, including parameter passing and return types. We focused on the difference between passing by value and passing by reference
   as it is one of the major concepts in programming.
3. Structures: Previous concepts of structures were revised and the focus was on how it helps us in grouping related variables together.
4. Classes: Initially, we used the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and how we can use concepts of composition and polymorphism in classes.
5. Templates: Understanding generic programming through class templates and functions.
6. File I/O: Working with file handling in C++ for reading and writing operations.
