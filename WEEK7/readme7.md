# 🔁 Double Linked List Template in C++

This project implements a **template-based doubly linked list** in C++. It provides a flexible and reusable data structure to store and manipulate elements in both forward and backward directions.

---

## 📌 Features

- Generic class using **C++ templates** to support any data type.
- Efficient **bidirectional traversal** using `prev` and `next` pointers.
- Support for:
  - Insertion at the front and back (`push_front`, `push_back`)
  - Deletion from the front and back (`pop_front`, `pop_back`)
- Array-based constructor to initialize the list from a static array.
- Automatic memory cleanup using a destructor.

---

## 🚀 Usage

The class is ideal for situations where:

- You need **fast insertions/deletions** from both ends.
- You want a **customizable linked list** that works with any data type.
- You are learning or working with **dynamic data structures** in C++.
