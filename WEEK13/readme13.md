# ðŸ”¢ Sorting Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of four classic sorting algorithms written in **C++**:

- ðŸ“Œ **Selection Sort**  
- ðŸ“Œ **Insertion Sort**  
- ðŸ“Œ **Bubble Sort**  
- ðŸ“Œ **Heap Sort**

## ðŸ§  Sorting Algorithm Descriptions

### âœ… Selection Sort
Selection Sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the beginning. It has poor performance on large lists.

- **Best Case Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)  
- **Average Case Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)  
- **Worst Case Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place)

### âœ… Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its proper position.

- **Best Case Time Complexity:** O(n) (when the array is already sorted)  
- **Average Case Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)  
- **Worst Case Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place)

### âœ… Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues until no swaps are needed.

- **Best Case Time Complexity:** O(n) (with optimization)  
- **Average Case Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)  
- **Worst Case Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place)

### âœ… Heap Sort
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a Binary Heap data structure. It builds a max-heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.

- **Best Case Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
- **Average Case Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
- **Worst Case Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place)
